			<p class="flavor">Ten times stronger than the common man and undisputed monarchs of the sea, the fishmen of the world oceans were for the longest time the boogeymen of sailors everywhere. Tall and proud warriors of the deep, the fishmen share a troubled history of racial discrimination and slavery at the hands of humans, scars that even centuries of peace with the surface world has yet to completely mend.<br/>  A lot of the prejudice against them stem from how they differ from humans, looking monstrous to the common man because of their half-fish, half-human physiology, but also because of their renowned physical superiority and ability to fight as well on land as in water.<br/>  Despite their fearsome reputation as pirates and marauders, the fishmen are not a simple or militaristic raceof savages that many humans believe them to be. A fishman dedicated to a crew or a cause tends to be loyal to a fault, willing to fight to the bitter end for what they believe in. </p>
		
			<h4>A HISTORY OF STRIFE</h4>
			<p>For centuries, the fishmen were considered little more than any other monster in the oceans by the humans and were treated accordingly, only welcome on the surface world as slaves if they weren't killed on sight. Eventually, the world government realized the benefits of peace between the races and made several attempts to mend the relationship between humans, fishmen and merfolk. Thanks in part to the actions of the fishman pirate Fisher Tiger and the merfolk queen Otohime, a peaceful coexistance was finally reached after decades of negotiations.<br/>  However, the old ways still rings loudly in the ears of both humans and fishmen alike, who have had a hard time leaving the past behind. Many humans, especially nobles, still consider fishmen to be nothing but monsters and fish. Conversely, many fishmen subscribe to the notion that their superior strength and adaptability means they should be ruling over humans, who they consider weak and cowardly.<br/> Even so, a strained peace still aided in softening the animosity between the races, and more fishmen and humans alike are beginning to wake up to the idea of co-existance, slowly beginning to see eachother as kin rather than enemies</p>
				
			<h4>CHAMPIONS OF THE SEA</h4>
			<p>In water, fishmen are second to none. Already on land a fishman can boast the strength of ten common humans, and this strength is only amplified by their amphibious nature. A fishman possesses both the gills of a fish and the respiratory system of a human, allowing them to breath air and water without issue, while dorsal fins and webbed hands and feet allow them to move unhindered in water.<br/>  In addition to these boons, fishmen have a unique form of martial arts known as Fishman Karate, which emphasizes the use of water to their advantage. It's a martial art that grows even more potent while near or submerged in water. This unique fighting style is only taught at certain dojos on fishman island and has a near mythical reputation that eaches even the surface world above.</p>
