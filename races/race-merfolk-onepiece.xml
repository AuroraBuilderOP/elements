			<p class="flavor">Merfolk, along with fish-men, are one of the two races of humanoids that inhabit the sea. Merfolk have the upper body of a human and the lower body of a fish. Both races are ruled by the undersea king, King Neptune.<br /> Merfolk have access to various skills while underwater, such as extremely fast swimming speeds, weapon proficiency, and the ability to communicate with many sea creatures. Very rarely, a mermaid can be born with the ability to speak with Sea Kings. Only a mermaid princess possesses this power, however. <br /></p>
			
			<h4>PEACEFUL</h4>
			<p>Unlike fish-men, merfolk are far more peaceful and prefer to live in secret away from most other races. Despite their differences, merfolk and fish-men get along very well. <br/></p>
				
			<h4>SEA TO LAND</h4>
			<p>Due to their lack of legs, they move very slowly on land. This makes sea travel their primary method of getting around, and they're very proficient at it. However, upon reaching the age of 30, their tails will split and allow them to walk on land much easier.<br/></p>
				
			<h4>VICTIMS OF SLAVERY</h4>
			<p>Despite their efforts to stay away from the surface, some merfolk still end up captured and sold into slavery. Because of their rarity, many can sell for incredibly high prices if they are under 30.<br/></p>
				
			<h4>BEAUTY AND GRACE</h4>
			<p>Merfolk are all considered incredibly beautiful by the standards of humans. This beauty is mostly lost when they reach the age of 30 when their tail splits. They are also far less brutish than fish-men, making them a bit less likely to be involved in physical altercations. Merfolk are more commonly involved in activities or occupations that involve their speed or intelligence. Though, many are stilled trained in the military and can use a fighting style known as Merman Combat.<br/></p>
